Design Patterns: The Design Patterns are documents written that contain a general solution about errors that appear many times in a project. This patterns can be used in many projects, but if the pattern isn’t the correct to the project could produce many errors. 
This patterns contains the instances, objects and dependencies that we can use in our projects and show the correct way to use them to solve some errors.
The Design pattern aren’t in a language programming, thanks to that the pattern can be used in differents programming languages.

Factory pattern: This is type of design pattern in Java, in which we have an interface “factory” that can create different’s type of object depending of the classes need. By example an interface than can draw shapes is considered a factory of shapes and this interface can create shapes such as circles, triangles and rectangles. This objects are different one of other but at the same time are shapes.
This type of design patter allow hide the “factory” to the client, because they only need use the classes to build their objects. This use the polymorphism because the classes can override the method’s factory and use as they required. 

Singleton pattern: This talk about the interface must be have a instance and provide a global access to them. A system with only an object is considered more efficient.
Or also allow restrict the number of instance of the interface.
By example, the principal of an school is a global point access to identifies all personal of the school.

Builder pattern: This type of patter don’t allow the polymorphism, because in the construction of an object use other objects more simples. By example to made a package of fast food in a restaurant, the package must be content a food,a drink and a desire. The final product is the package but one of there may contain water and other soda or juice, the product final is the same but the contain of there are different.

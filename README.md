Testing example for begginers

S-Single responsibility principle: This concept say that every class only will have 	one job, that’s mean that the system should be separate in different modules 	and everyone should will have a job. That help to make easier at the moment 	when in necessary change the code, because the module that need the change is 	the only that will change.

O-Open/closed principle: This principle mean the classes, modules or functions should 	be “open” by an	 “extension” to allow add code or elements at the classes.
	Also say that the classes should be closed when other classes have access to 	them, that’s mean that the classes that will call must be correct and 	don’t have errors. The inheritance it’s based in this principle.

L-Liskov substitution principle: This principle says that an object is a subtype of 	other object, in the code the first object can be replaced by elements of the 	second element and the change must’n create problems in the source code.
	This principle is useful to create and design the hierarchies of the classes.

I-Interface segregation principle: The principle states that the users won’t be 		forced 	to use functions or classes that they don’t need. To make this 		possible is necessary to divide the jobs in “role interface” and the user only 	use the role that is needs. Because if all job are in one class and is necessary 	to make a change, this may generate many errors in the source code.

D-Dependency inversion principle: Thats mean that the High-level modules must not 		depend to Low-level modules, and both must be depended to abstractions.
